This is an experimental library that implements the WebFinger protocol.  It includes type definitions for WebFinger data structures, along with some utilities for sending and receiving WebFinger requests

Digit is performing well in [Emissary](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/emissary) without any problems, but it is still new enough that you should still treat it with caution.
